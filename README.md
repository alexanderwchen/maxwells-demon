## Setup
- This game contains three source code files "MaxwellsDemon.java", "MainPanel.java", "Particle.java".
- All three files are necessary to set up the game.
- The "MaxwellsDemon.java" class contains the main() to start.

## Tasks

- Understand how to design a graphical user interface
  - Design the look of a graphical interface
  - Implement your design using Swing containers and components
- Understand how to model a simple physical system
  - Choose appropriate data model and storage strategy for your game
  - Understand how to use the model to create your program view
- Understand how to use event-driven programming to update your game
  - Choose appropriate event generators like buttons or timers
  - Create corresponding event listeners to respond to these events
  - Properly update your model in response to events

## Description

Based on the 19th century mathematical physicist James Maxwell's equations on thermodynamics. This game creates two boxes with a door in between allowing the user to open and close the door to allow slow and fast particles to pass through. The user can manipulate the tempratures of both sides to see their progress.

##How to Play
The game is simple to play. There are three actions you may make.

1. Click on the "Add Particles" button. This will add one cold and one hot particle to each side. You may add as many particles as you would like to.

2. Click on the "RESET" button. This will reset the particle count back to zero and reset temperatures.

3. Click and hold anywhere on the screen. This will open the door to allow particles to enter from one side ot another.

##Features
The game displays the scaled temperature (0-100) of each side of the game.
